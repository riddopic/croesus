  # Define the #get, #post, and #delete helper methods for sending HTTP
  # requests to the Delphix engine. You shouldn't need to use these methods
  # directly, but they can be useful for debugging.
  #
  # The following HTTP methods are supported by the Delphix Appliance:
  #
  #    GET - Retrieve data from the server where complex input is not needed.
  #          All GET requests are guaranteed to be read-only, but not all
  #          read-only requests are required to use GET. Simple input
  #          (strings, number, boolean values) can be passed as query
  #          parameters.
  #   POST - Issue a read/write operation, or make a read-only call that
  #          requires complex input. The optional body of the call is
  #          expressed as JSON.
  # DELETE - Delete an object on the system. For languages that don't provide
  #          a native wrapper for DELETE, or for delete operations with
  #          optional input, all delete operations can also be invoked as POST
  #          to the same URL with /delete appended to it.
  #
  # Each method returns a hash that responds to #code, #headers, #body and
  # #raw_body obtained from parsing the JSON object in the response body.
  #
  # @param url [String<URL>] url the url of where to send the request
  # @param [Hash{Symbol => String}] parameters key-value data of the HTTP
  # API request
  # @param [Block] block block to execute when the request returns
  # @return [Fixnum, #code] the response code from Delphix engine
  # @return [Hash, #headers] headers, beautified with symbols and underscores
  # @return [Hash, #body] body parsed response body where applicable (JSON
  # responses are parsed to Objects/Associative Arrays)
  # @return [Hash, #raw_body] raw_body un-parsed response body
  #
  # @api semipublic
